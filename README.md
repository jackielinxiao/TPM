# TPM
Codes for TPM, a tree based model for watch time prediction

The dataset is collected from CIKM16 Cup. The dataset contains sequences of anonymous transactions provide by DIGINETICA. The input involves session_id, viewed_item_list, length of viewed items and the label is the dwell time of each session (which is referred to as duration in this dataset). Therefore the dataset does not contain an explicit confounding factor.
